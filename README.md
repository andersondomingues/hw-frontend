# hw-frontend

This is the frontend part of my implementation of the Jack's Warehouse system. The following technologies were employed:  

* Node (https://nodejs.org/en/)
* ReactJS (https://reactjs.org/)
* Typescript (https://www.typescriptlang.org/)
* SCSS (through modules, SASS - https://sass-lang.com/)

How to run:

* Make sure that port http/3000 is available. Otherwise, you can change the application port by modifying the 
* a `.env` at the root folder with the following entry `REACT_APP_BACKEND_URL=http://localhost:4000`.
